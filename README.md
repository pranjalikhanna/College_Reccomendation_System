# College_Reccomendation_System

Objective: To create a system that helps students find suitable colleges based on specific criteria, such as their preferred major and budget constraints.

Outcome: The recommendation system provided basic functionality for filtering and recommending colleges, showcasing algorithmic skills and logic in Java programming.

Model Used and Why:

Rule-Based Filtering and Recommendation Algorithm: A simple rule-based algorithm was used rather than a machine learning model, as the goal was to develop foundational logic for filtering based on static criteria (major and budget). This method was chosen for its simplicity and relevance to the objective, allowing straightforward retrieval of relevant college options without complex computations.
